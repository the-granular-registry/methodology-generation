# Glossary

## Account&#x20;

A record of the Certificates held on a Registry by a company or individual.&#x20;

## Account Holder&#x20;

## Attribute&#x20;

A data item on a Certificate specifying the characteristics of an energy unit produced by a Production Device in terms of the input(s) used and/or the details of that Production Device and production process.&#x20;

## Avoided Emissions&#x20;

## Beneficiary&#x20;

## Bidding Zone&#x20;

The largest geographical area within which market participants are able to exchange energy without capacity allocation. For example, Bidding Zones in Europe are currently defined according to differing criteria. While the majority are defined by national borders (e.g. France or the Netherlands), some are larger than national borders (e.g. Austria, Germany and Luxembourg or the Single Electricity Market for the island of Ireland), while others are smaller zones within individual countries (e.g., Italy, Norway or Sweden). In the US, Bidding Zones are analogous to market zones where the locational marginal price is the same (e.g. NYISO-Zone D in NYISO).&#x20;

## Cancel&#x20;

To remove a Certificate from an Account, either

1. as proof of the Attributes (source, production time, etc.), to prevent it from being used again for this purpose, and to prevent it from being Transferred to another Account, or
2. to Reserve it for transitioning into another Certificate system.&#x20;
