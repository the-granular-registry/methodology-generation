# Additionality Indicators

Assessing additionality in the renewable energy industry is complex and often debated. PECs will include essential contextual and project-specific information to support stakeholders in evaluating additionality. This transparency allows stakeholders to determine the most important criteria and identify PECs that align with their sustainability values.

## Additionality Information included for all PECs:

* **Project Age/Vintage:** The year the project commenced operations, providing insight into the project's lifecycle and alignment with current technological advancements.
* **Project Contractual Status:** Information on whether the project is under a PPA, repowering contract, or an EAC agreement, indicating long-term commitments to renewable energy generation.
* **Mandated Generation:** Details on whether the project is part of a utility rate base or supported by state-funded life extension programs, reflecting its role in mandated renewable energy contributions.
* **Compliance CFE:** Information on whether the projectâ€™s output is used to satisfy state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) or Clean Energy Standard (CES) programs, indicating compliance-driven generation.
