# Wildlife Conservation and Habitat

We have adopted the comprehensive matrix provided by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to assess and guide the environmental impact of energy-related projects. This matrix promotes sustainable development and ensures projects contribute positively to conservation and habitat goals. The key components of this matrix include:

* **Biodiversity:** This criterion assesses the impact of projects on local ecosystems and species. It aims to preserve and enhance biodiversity through various project activities. Metrics may include the number of species protected, habitat restoration efforts, and measures to mitigate habitat disruption.
* **Ecosystem quality:** This criterion evaluates the avoided emissions to terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems caused by a particular project and the impact of those emissions reductions on ecosystem quality and biodiversity.
* **Water Resources:** This criterion evaluates the project's impact on water quality and availability. It includes considerations for watershed protection and sustainable water use. Key indicators involve measures to prevent water pollution, strategies for sustainable water consumption, and efforts to maintain or improve local water ecosystems.

## SDGs Supported:

* SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
