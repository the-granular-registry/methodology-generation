# Community Impact and Social Justice

We integrate social equity and community benefits into PECs to ensure CFE projects deliver broader social value. Our approach encompasses a comprehensive matrix to quantify the following attributes, promoting social justice, economic inclusion, and equitable development:

* **Community Investment:** Projects must demonstrate a significant investment in local communities, fostering job creation and economic opportunities. Priority is given to initiatives that support underrepresented and marginalized groups. Metrics may include the number of local jobs created, investment in local infrastructure, and support for community programs.
* **Equitable Access:** We ensure that renewable energy's benefits, such as reduced energy costs and improved air quality, reach all communities. Special focus is given to historically underserved or disproportionately affected areas. Key indicators include the percentage of renewable energy directed to low-income households and improvements in local environmental conditions.
* **Inclusive Workforce Development:** This initiative aims to diversify the renewable energy workforce by training and employing women, minorities, and economically disadvantaged individuals. It includes educational and vocational training programs to build local capacity. Metrics involve the diversity of the workforce, the number of training programs conducted, and the success rate of program participants in securing employment.
* **Environmental Justice:** Projects must address the disproportionate environmental impacts on marginalized communities. Priority is given to initiatives that enhance environmental quality in these areas. Indicators include reductions in local pollution levels, improvements in public health metrics, and community feedback on environmental improvements.
