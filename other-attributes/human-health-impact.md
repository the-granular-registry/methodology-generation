# Human Health Impact

The public health impacts caused by a renewable energy project vary greatly based on the quantity of air pollutant emissions reduced and where they are reduced.  For example, a renewable energy project operating in a fossil fuel-intensive grid that reduces emissions upwind of densely populated areas can have 10 â€“ 20 times the impact on public health as a renewable energy project operating in a cleaner grid and reducing emissions downwind of densely populated areas.

A detailed matrix to assess and guide the health impact of energy-related projects has been developed to ensure that renewable energy projects improve public health. This matrix focuses on reducing air pollution, promoting well-being, and increasing life expectancy.

* **Air Pollution:** This criterion evaluates the project's impact on air quality, aiming to reduce pollutants such as particulate matter (PM-eq), photochemical oxidants (NOx-eq), and human toxicity emissions. Metrics may include avoided air pollutant reductions improving local air quality indices, and the corresponding impacts on public health.
